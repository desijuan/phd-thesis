2 VB-groupoids

2.1 VB-groupoids
2.2 RUTH
Pseudo-representation, RUTH, morphism.
2.3


Pullback groupoid


2.1
core, anchor, morphisms in examples
2.1.1 Core and anchor map. In fact, the anchor map completely codify the 2vect [int. ref.]
2.1.2 remark that if G is etale then core is 0.
2.1.3 Actually...
dual of vector bundle
example of acycle: pair groupoid of vector bundle
Proposition: characterization of acyclic
VBgpd with side 0
VBgpd with anchor 0

2.2
induce representations in cohomology (non-smooth, over each orbit, constant rank)
adjoint representation

pseudo-representation, example
ruth and morphism
